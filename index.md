Welcome, and thank you for visiting my website!

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences in Uppsala, Sweden. I am part of the development team for [TreePPL](https://treeppl.org/), a probabilistic programming language for phylogenetics. My research focuses on creating statistical tools to assess model performance and adequacy, and to carry out model comparison in Bayesian settings.

Beyond that, I am a zoologist with a strong interest in phylogenetic comparative methods. I use them to study trait evolution in scorpions, which I consider the coolest animals on Earth (after my cat).
