Welcome, and thank you for visiting my website!

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences in Uppsala, Sweden. I am part of the development team for [TreePPL](https://treeppl.org/), a probabilistic programming language for phylogenetics. My research focuses on creating statistical tools to assess model performance and adequacy, and to carry out model comparison in Bayesian settings using R.

Beyond that, I am a zoologist with a strong interest in phylogenetic comparative methods. I use them to study trait evolution in scorpions, which I consider the coolest animals on Earth (after my cat).
